        <h2>hey!</h2>
        <p>my name is maree, and i am currently a student/ part-time barista/
            aspiring web and ux/ui designer. i am a recent college graduate who, truthfully,
            didn't want know what to do with my degree and realized that the things i have been most
            passionate about has always been towards creative expression. 
            <br> <br>
            my decision to pursue a career in web and ux/ui design comes from seeing and interacting
            with aesthetically-pleasing and smooth interfaces daily, and knowing that it can be
            an interactive work of art that can be appreciated by the masses. while i'm not the most technically-proficient,
            the design aspect at the core is what's the most appealing to me. 
            <br><br>
            when i'm not learning how to be a ux/ui designer, i make coffee as a part-time barista and indulge myself in many 
            of my hobbies--drawing, dancing, baking, gaming. most recently, i purchased a digital art tablet which has been loads of fun!
